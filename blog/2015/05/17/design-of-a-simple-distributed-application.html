    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Today I’m going to explain how to design a simple distributed application. The goal is to read a really big file into memory. Since the file doesn’t fit in a single machine’s memory we need to design a system to split the file across different machines. A possible architecture comprises a <code>master</code> that breaks the file into smaller chunks and <code>N workers</code> that process those chunks.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/usecase.png" alt="Use case" /></p>

<p>The master should implement the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A way to split the work across workers. Different policies like round-robin or sending to the worker with less requests in flight are possible.</li>
  <li>A way of registering workers.</li>
  <li>A way to monitor the workers, notice if they go down and send their pending splits to other workers.</li>
  <li>A way to timeout if there are no workers registered or the operation takes too long.</li>
</ul>

<p>Master and workers communicate using the following <code>protobuf</code> messages over a <code>zeromq</code> transport:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FETCH_SPLIT_REQUEST: master -&gt; worker. Asks the worker to fetch a split.</li>
  <li>FETCH_SPLIT_RESPONSE: worker -&gt; master. The worker communicates the result of the operation to the master.</li>
  <li>HEARTBEAT_REQUEST: master -&gt; worker. Send to the worker to make sure it is alive.</li>
  <li>HEARTBEAT_RESPONSE: worker -&gt; master. Send response back to the master.</li>
  <li>REGISTRATION: worker -&gt; master. Register worker into the master.</li>
  <li>SHUTDOWN: master -&gt; worker. Used to shut down the worker.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application works as follows. First the workers register with the master and at that point the master starts sending split requests to them. At a periodic interval the master sends heartbeats to check that the workers are still alive. If a worker doesn’t reply to a heartbeat the master removes the worker and re-sends the outstanding requests to other workers that are alive.
This continues until all the splits are complete.</p>

<h3 id="master-architecture">Master architecture</h3>
<p>We divide the master into 2 components: <code>master</code> and <code>transport</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/arch.png" alt="Architecture" /></p>

<p><code>master</code> is in charge of sending <code>Fetch Split Requests</code>, sending <code>heartbeats</code> and processing <code>responses</code> from workers.</p>

<p><code>transport</code> is in charge of sending and receiving the messages.</p>

<p>To make the design cleaner we run <code>master</code> and <code>transport</code> in different threads and communicate them using a thread-safe producer consumer queue. Using different threads makes the application more responsive. E.g. if the master is taking a long time generating requests or processing responses the transport can still send and receive messages. This is the master’s pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>splits = splitFile(filename)
while (splits.size() &gt; 0) {
  now = get_time();
  if ((now - lastSplitResponseTime) &gt; timeoutInterval) errorAndExit();
  if ((now - lastheartbeatSendTime) &gt; heartbeatSendInterval) sendHeartbeat();
  if ((now - lastHeartbeatCheckTime) &gt; hearbeatCheckInterval) checkHeartbeats();
  if (requestQueue.hasFreeSlots()) sendSplit();
  if (responseQueue.hasValidData()) processResponse();
}
shutdown(workers);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the queues are not blocking. This allows us to keep sending requests even if there are no responses and viceversa.</p>

<p>At a certain point in time the queues will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/queues.png" alt="Queues" /></p>

<p>This is just a very simple design. One possible problem is that the heartbeat requests/responses may be delayed if there are too many Fetch Splits requests/responses in the queue. Another option would be to have a separate queue with higher priority for heartbeats (i.e. <code>transport</code> would always empty the heartbeat queue first).
Another option is to have a whole separate <code>zeromq</code> socket for heartbeats.</p>

<h3 id="transport-architecture">Transport architecture</h3>

<p>The transport layer is responsible for sending and receiving messages. As in the master case is not blocking:</p>

<pre><code>while (1) {
  hasResponses = poll_for_responses();
  if (hasResponses) responseQueue.add(response);
  if (requestqueue.hasValiData()) sendToWorker(data);
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="worker-architecture">Worker architecture</h3>
<p>The worker is very simple. It receives requests, does the work and sends a response in a closed loop.</p>

<pre><code>while (1) {
  req = block_for_request();
  if(req == shutdown) break;
  rsp = doWork(rep);
  sendToMaster(rsp);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The complete code is on <a href="https://github.com/jorgemarsal/distributor">Github</a> in case you want to take a closer look ;).</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>When you have a big problem scaling out across a cluster of commodity machines can be a good option.</p>

<p>In big clusters machines fail so we need a way to check for failures and react to them.</p>

<p>In this example the master is not fault tolerant. We could implement a fault tolerant system using something like  <a href="https://github.com/logcabin/logcabin">Logcabin</a> or <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">Zookeeper</a>.</p>
